Laying Plans
計篇第一

Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
孫子曰：兵者，國之大事。

It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry that can on no account be neglected.
死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也。


The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to 
determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
故經之以五，校之以計，而索其情。
